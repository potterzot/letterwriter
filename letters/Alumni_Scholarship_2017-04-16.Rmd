Dear Contributors to the Deboch Memorial Graduate Fellowship:

I'm truly honored to receive a scholarship in Tesfaye Deboch's name. For me receiving this scholarship means more than much appreciated financial support, it is also a vote of confidence from the CAHNRS award committee and a message that the college considers me a valuable member of the community.

But I'm also thankful to receive this specific scholarship because until writing this letter I was not aware of Tesfay Girma Deboch's story. The loss of this graduate student is tragic, and the establishment of a memorial scholarship in his name feels especially generous and important to me. I'll work hard to use these funds in a way that uphold its goals and Deboch's name.

For two years I lived in West Africa as a Peace Corps volunteer. That time taught me a lot about myself and about the cares and concerns common to all of humanity. I hope that in my time as a PhD student at WSU and in my career afterward, I can keep those lessons with me to inform my research and other work.

All of my best, and in sincere appreciation,
